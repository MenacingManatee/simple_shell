hsh - holberton simple-shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [options and files are not currently supported, but planned to be implemented]
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is a command language interpreter compatible with standard bash files. Hsh executes commands read from stdin.
.SH OPTIONS
Hsh has two main operating options - interactive and non-interactive
In interactive mode, hsh acts as a standard shell
Interactive mode may be enabled by calling hsh as a program with no pipes or options
In non-interactive mode, a command is piped into hsh, which is then interpreted as normal
.SH hsh Builtin Commands

[
.I status
]

.SH BUGS
Compound commands are unable to be handled

Comments are unable to be handled

Aliases do not currently work

When calling the cd builtin, cd - does not always go to $OLDPWD as intended

When calling the cd builtin, $PWD and $OLDPWD are not updated, causing the above bug
